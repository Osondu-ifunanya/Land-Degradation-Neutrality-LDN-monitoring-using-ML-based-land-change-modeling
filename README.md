# 🏜️ Land Degradation Neutrality Monitoring using Synthetic Data and Machine Learning

## Overview
This project simulates and analyzes land degradation using synthetic indicators such as NDVI change, land cover change, productivity, and rainfall variation. A machine learning model classifies areas as degraded or neutral.

## Features
- Synthetic dataset with five environmental indicators
- Random Forest classification model
- Binary output: degraded (1) vs. neutral/improving (0)
- Visualized feature importance and model performance metrics

## Requirements
- Python 3.7+
- Libraries: numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib

## Usage
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib
